Data Version Control (DVC) - Complete guide and commands

Steps :

  A. Make the project directory which will contain the project files and data 
	  

  B. Follow the below commands
      
     >ls  command for listing all the directories
     
     > git init  -> For initilaization of repo
     
     > dvc init -> For dvc initialization
     
     > dvc add *  -> for adding the .dvc files in the staging area
     
     > ls -alh
     
     > git add .gitignore mnist_train.csv.dvc 
     
     > git commit -m "Adding the training data"
    
     > dvc remote add -d storage gdrive://auth_code_folder_location -> Here add_auth_code_folder_location is id of google drive location
     
     > git commit .dvc/config -m "Config remote storage"

    > dvc push -> This command will push the data into the google drive mentioned location
    
    > pip install pydrive2 -> If u get error then install this lib
    
    > git remort add origin https://github.com/gss-coder/MST.git
    
    > git branch -M main
    
    > git push  -u origin main
    
    > Enter the login id  and password of github repo 
       Finally your project files will be pushed into github and data will be on Drive and now can track your data and files simultaneously
       
   
  
  
  C. Lets try to retrieve the data after deleting it from the local.
	
    > rm -rf .dvc/cache  -> Remove the data from the cache
    
    > rm -f mnist_train.csv -> Remove the data from the local file system 
    
    > dvc pull -> Pull the data from the drive 
    
  
  
  
  
  D. Making changes - For the sake of simplicity letâ€™s just double the dataset artificially 
                                        and pretend that we got more data from someexternal source


     > cp mnist_train.csv /tmp/mnist_train.csv
     
     > cat /tmp/mnist_train.csv >> mnist_train.csv
     
     > dvc status -> Track the changes i.e changes in the data
     
     > dvc add mnist_train.csv
     
     > git commit mnist_train.csv.dvc -m "Dataset updates"
     
     > dvc push -> New data will be pushed
